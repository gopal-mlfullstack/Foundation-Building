        Building my first website was a huge milestone. I started with just HTML
        and CSS, learning how to structure a page, add colors, and adjust
        spacing using margin and padding.

        The most important lesson I learned was: keep it simple. Focus on clean
        layout, readable fonts, and consistent colors. Once that’s done, you can
        add more advanced features like responsive design and animations.
      </p>

        Over time, I realized that front-end web development is a mix of art and
        logic. With every new project, your confidence grows — so start today!
