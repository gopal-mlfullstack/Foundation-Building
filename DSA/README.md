# 🧠 DSA Week 1: Arrays and Strings

This directory (`Week1_Arrays/`) is part of a **6-week plan** to master **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in Python.
**Week 1** focuses on solving **20–25 easy array and string problems** to build strong foundational problem-solving skills.

---

## 📅 Week 1 Plan

### 🎯 Goal

Solve **20–25 easy LeetCode problems** (3–4 per day) within 6 days.

### 🧩 Topics Covered

* Array traversal and manipulation
* Two-pointer technique
* Sliding window basics
* String operations and analysis

### 🕒 Daily Tasks

* Solve **3–4 problems daily** (2–3 hours).
* Save solutions in:

  ```
  Week1_Arrays/problems/
  ```
* Test each solution on **LeetCode**.
* Review related concepts if stuck (use **GeeksforGeeks** or **LeetCode Discussions**).
* Track your progress (aim for **20–25/25** problems completed).
